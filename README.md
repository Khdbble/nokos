# Nok OS

Operating system made by myself. Work in progress.

Reference: https://samypesse.gitbook.io/how-to-create-an-operating-system/

> The goal is to build a very simple UNIX-based operating system in C++, not just a "proof-of-concept". The OS should be able to boot, start a userland shell, and be extensible.
